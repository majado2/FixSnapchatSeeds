# XML Feed Modifier

This project is used for modifying XML feeds served on a web server. The code is written in Python and uses the BeautifulSoup library for parsing and modifying the feeds, and the Flask library for setting up the web application.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- BeautifulSoup4
- Flask
- requests

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

First, run `generate.py` to download, parse, modify the XML file and save the result:

```shell
python generate.py
```

After that, you can run `app.py` to start the application that will serve the modified file when accessing the application's home page:

```shell
python app.py
```

The application will be available on `http://localhost:5000` (or whichever IP address you specify).
